title: "Week 11 - Classification"

This week we will buld a classifier. We start by taking some data and preparing it for our classification algorithm. We will then split the data into training, validation and test the model

To get started, log into RStudio on your cloud instance (http://your-ip-address/rstudio) or if you prefer, on your own computer. See the Week 8 lab for details.


- See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Classification for examples on how to use the e1071 package to classify data
- See http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/ for information on the ROCR package
- See http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/pubs/sbtpaper/ for explanations on phenotypic varables for the breast cancer dataset


### Reminders

You can use `help()` or the `?` operator to get help on any function in R. This also works on many libraries once they are loaded.

To get help on an R operator or R keyword, you can put it in backquotes, e.g. ``help(`+`)`` or ``?`if` ``.

To see a small part of a large variable like a matrix or data frame, try `head()`.

Data frames and matrices can both be indexed with syntax like `X[rows, columns]`. The rows and columns you want can be specified in several ways, including:

- Numerical vectors specifying which rows/columns we want, e.g. `alldata[1:3,1:10]`
- Logical (TRUE/FALSE) vectors. These will return any rows/columns corresponding to TRUE values in the vector. For instance, `alldata[alldata$chromosome_name == "Y",]` returns rows where the chromosome name is Y.
- Names of columns or rows. The count for patient M00103_M, gene ENSG00000156639, can be retrieved with `alldata["ENSG00000156639","M00103_M"]`

### Data and libraries

In this lab we will again use data from the R package breastCancerNKI in Bioconductor. To install all the packages we'll need, run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("breastCancerNKI")
biocLite("Biobase")
install.packages("gplots")
install.packages("e1071")
install.packages("ROCR")
```

Once installed, use the `library()` command to load each of these packages into your R session. You should also load the `nki` data with the `data()` command.



### Expression matrix
- Start with your expression matrix from last week ordered by variance
- Limit the samples to those belonging to the dataset “NKI”
- Remove germline brca carriers (hint: look at the phenotype matrix)
- Pick the top x genes to put into your classifier (hint: use the heatmap from last week to inform your selection)
- Create a vector (as.factor) of your class label (in this case whether they had a distant nki metastasis)


### Training, Testing, Validation
Split your data into a training set and test set
